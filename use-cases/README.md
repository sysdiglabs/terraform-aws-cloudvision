# Secure for Cloud Use Cases

## Cloud Platforms

### Feature Summary

| Cloud | Single Setup | Organizational Setup | Event Source | Compute Deployment Options | Sysdig Role Setup | Image Scanning Options | Spawned Scanning Service
| -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS | Account | Organization with member accounts | Cloudtrail | K8S `-k8s`, ECS `-ecs`, AppRunner `-apprunner` | IAM Role with Trusted Identity | ECS deployed images,<br/>ECR, Public Repositories | Codebuild project |
| GCP | Project | Organization with member projects | Project/Organization Sink,<br/> GCR PubSub Topic | K8S `-k8s`, CloudRun | Workload Identity Federation | CloudRun deployed images,<br/>GCR, Public Repositories |Cloudbuild task |
| Azure | Subscription | Tenant subscriptions| EventHub, Eventgrid | K8S `-k8s`, AzureContainerInstances (ACI) | Azure Lighthouse | ACI deployed images,<br/> ACR, Public Repositories | ACR Task |


### Which Compute Deployment Should I Choose?

There are no preffered way, just take a technology you're familiar with. Otherwise, prefer non-K8S, as it will be harder to maintain.
For AWS, beware of [AppRunner region limitations](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/blob/master/examples/single-account-apprunner/README.md#prerequisites).


### Pre-Existing Resource Usage

Make use of optionals to reuse pre-existing resources and prevent incurring in more costs.

|  Cloud |  Optionals | Related Input Vars | Other |
| -- | --| -- | -- |
| AWS  | Cloudtrail | single: [`cloudtrail_sns_arn`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/single-account-ecs#input_cloudtrail_sns_arn)<br/>organizational: [`existing_cloudtrail_config`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/organizational#input_existing_cloudtrail_config) |  For organizational example, optional resources must exist in the management account. For other setups check other alternative use-cases |
| | ECS, VPC, Subnet | `ecs_cluster_name`, `ecs_vpc_id`, `ecs_vpc_subnets_private_ids` | if used, the three are mandatory  |
| GCP | - | - | - |
| Azure | ResourceGroup | `resource_group_name` | - |
| | ACR | `registry_name`, `registry_resource_group_name` | - |
| * | Compute Workload | - | All clouds allow Sysdig Secure for cloud to be deployed on a pre-existing K8S cluster|

### Overview

Current examples were developed for simple scenarios.
As new use cases emerge, we will establish a standard scenario and create new examples to accommodate additional requirements.
Check the current list of use cases or use the [questionnaire](./_questionnaire.md) to let us know your needs.

If Terraform or Cloudformation suits your purpose, take a look at the `manual-*` prefixed use cases.

## AWS-Specific Guidelines

Secure for cloud is installed in AWS either by using [terraform](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud) or by using a [Cloudformation](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/aws-templates-secure-for-cloud) template.

| Deployment Type   | all Sysdig resources will be deployed within the selected account | Most Sysdig resources will be deployed within the selected account (just one), but some features, require resources to be deployed on all of the member-accounts (for Compliance and Image Scanning) . <br />One role is needed on the management account for cloudtrail-s3 event access |
| Target          | will only analyse current account                                 |  handles all accounts (managed and member) + dynamically created new member accounts|
| Drawbacks         | cannot re-use another account Cloudtrail data (unless its deployed on the same account where the sns/s3 bucket is) | for scanning, a per-member-account access role is required |
| Optional resources usage limitations | - |  For organizational example, Cloudtrail resources cloudtrail-s3 and cloudtrail-sns, must exist in the management account.

| More Info | [AWS single-ecs](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/single-account-ecs), [AWS single-apprunner](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/single-account-apprunner), [AWS single-k8s](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/single-account-k8s) | [AWS organizational](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/organizational) |

With both examples `single` and `org`, you can customize the desired features to de deployed with the `deploy_*` input vars to avoid deploying more than wanted.

### Unified Compliance

If you just want [CIS Unified Compliance Benchmarks](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/posture/compliance/compliance-unified-/)
see [Compliance role-only deployment with Terraform](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-secure-for-cloud/deploy-sysdig-secure-for-cloud-agentless/)
<br/>Alternatively, you can [configure it manually](./manual-compliance.md)
