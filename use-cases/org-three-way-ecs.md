# OrganizationSetup - Three way Cross-Account - ECS

## Use-Case explanation

This use case will cover a three-way cross-account setup (typical from AWS ControlTower landing page).
With ECS as workload-type.
<br/>This is terraform-based guidelines, but can also check [Manual Organizational Setup - Three-Way Cross-Account ](./manual-org-three-way.md)


**User Infrastructure Setup**

This is the scenario we're going to recreate

1. Management Account / Accounts
   - Either there is an Organizational Cloudtrail reporting to the log archive account
   - Or several accounts reporting to the same log archive account
2. Log Archive Account
   - Cloudtrail-S3 bucket, with event notification to an SNS > SQS
3. Workload/Security Member Account
   - Sysdig Secure for cloud deployment
   - Optionally, we can re-use an existing VPC/subnet network setup.
   - 2 and 3 account points may be same account, we will cover both options.

This use-case cover following **[Sysdig Secure For CloudFeatures](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/sysdig-secure-for-cloud/#features)**
  - Threat-Detection
  - Posture; Compliance + Identity Access Management
  - :warning: Cloud image scanning is not available for this use-case
<br/><br/>


## Suggested setup

- Default `organizational` example is pre-configured to work with managed-account level resources (cloudtrail, s3, sns and sqs resources).
- We will make use of an **alternative event ingestion v√≠a S3 Event Notification, with a SNS-SQS forwarder**.
- It's important that all existing resources (cloudtrail-s3, cloudtrail-s3-sns-sqs, and sysdig workload), are **within same AWS_REGION**.
- If cross-account resources are to be accessed, we will need to set up some IAM Roles.
- Optionally, for **existing VPC/Subnet** usage, we will make use of the optional variables. Right now these two fields also require an ECS cluster to be configured.


### Step-by-Step Example Guide

<!--

all in same region
management account - cloudtrail (no kms for quick test)
log archive account - s3, sns, sqs

0.1 Provision an S3 bucket in the selected region and allow cloudtrail access
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "S3_ARN/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Statement2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "S3_ARN"
        }
    ]
}

0.2. Provision the s3 bucket sns event notification. Need to add permissions to SNS
{
      "Sid": "AllowS3ToPublishSNS",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": [
        "SNS:Publish"
      ],
      "Resource": "S3_ARN"
    }
-->


#### 1. Configure `AWS_PROFILE` with an organizational Administration credentials

Sysdig Secure for cloud will create resources both on your management account, and member-accounts.

Refer to [General Permissions](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud#required-permissions) to get more detail on what's required,
and [Organizational Role Summary](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/organizational#role-summary) for this specific use-case scenario.

#### 2. Choose an Organizational **Member account for Sysdig Workload** to be deployed.

This accountID will be required in the `SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID` parameter

#### 3. Pre-Terraform Requirements

#### 3.1 (Optional) Re-use of existing VPC/Subnet

  - Create an ECS cluster and configure it with the existing VPC/Subnet/... network configuration suiting your needs.
  - Refer to [Sysdig SASS Region and IP Ranges Documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/saas-regions-and-ip-ranges/) to get Sysdig SaaS endpoint and allow both outbound (for compute vulnerability report) and inbound (for scheduled compliance checkups)
  - ECS type deployment will create following [security-group setup](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/blob/master/modules/services/cloud-connector-ecs/sec-group.tf)

#### 3.2 (Optional) S3 and Sysdig Workload are in different accounts

If  `SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID` is different to the account where the S3 is located, we need to allow
cross-account access through a role.

Permission setup for SysdigSecureForCloud-S3AccessRole

- Create a `SysdigSecureForCloud-S3AccessRole` in the same account where the S3 bucket exists.
- Give it whatever trust-permissions you feel comfortable with, we will edit it later.
- Add permissions to be able to read from the S3 bucket (create a resource/action pinned policy if required)
  ```text
  {
   "Sid": "AllowSysdigToRead",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
   "Resource": [
       "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_ARN>/*"
   ]
  }
  ```
- Fetch the created role arn as `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_ROLE_ARN`


#### 3.3 Cloudtrail S3 ingestion through Event-Forward

When Cloudtrail-SNS is not available, or the Cloudtrail-S3 events are in an account different to the management
account, we will rely on a S3 Event Forwarder, to allow the workload to ingest events more easily.

Secure for Cloud requires an SQS queue from which it can ingest events, and this will provide
`CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_ARN` and `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_URL` for later installation.

We provide a module to create this
[Cloudtrail S3 bucket event-forwarder into an SNS>SQS](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/infrastructure/cloudtrail_s3-sns-sqs)
but you can do it manually too.

This module must not run on the same terraform (plan) sequence, because it will have cycle dependecies not resolved and will fail.

```terraform

# provider for S3 account
# this is a sample authentication, can adapt it as long as alias is maintained
provider "aws"{
  alias = "s3"
  region = "<AWS_REGION>"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::<S3_BUCKET_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  }
}

module "cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs" {
  providers = {
    aws = aws.s3
  }
  source  = "sysdiglabs/secure-for-cloud/aws//modules/infrastructure/cloudtrail_s3-sns-sqs"
  cloudtrail_s3_name = "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_NAME>"
}
```

Inspect `terraform state list` to gather these two values, `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_ARN` and `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_URL`.


#### 4. Launch Terraform Manifest

Let's create the Terraform manifest module parametrization, based on `examples/organizational`.
<br/>Get detailed explanation of each variable bellow.

```terraform

terraform {
  required_providers {
    sysdig = {
      source  = "sysdiglabs/sysdig"
    }
  }
}

provider "sysdig" {
  sysdig_secure_url         = "<SYSDIG_SECURE_URL>"
  sysdig_secure_api_token   = "<SYSDIG_SECURE_API_TOKEN>"
}

# provider used to deploy RO compliance role on organizational accounts
provider "aws" {
  region = "<AWS_REGION>"
}

# provider used to deploy sfc on the selected member-account
# this is a sample authentication, can adapt it as long as alias is maintaned
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "member"
  region = "<AWS_REGION>"
  assume_role {
    # 'OrganizationAccountAccessRole' is the default role created by AWS for management-account users to be able to admin member accounts.
    # if this is changed, please change to the `examples/organizational` input var `organizational_member_default_admin_role` too
    # <br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::<SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  }
}

module "sysdig-sfc" {
  providers = {
    aws.member = aws.member
  }

  source = "sysdiglabs/secure-for-cloud/aws//examples/organizational"
  name   = "sysdig-sfc"

  sysdig_secure_for_cloud_member_account_id="<SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID>"

  #  optional, if no VCP wants to be re-used
  ecs_cluster_name              = "<ECS_CLUSTER_NAME>"
  ecs_vpc_id                    = "<ECS_VPC_ID>"
  ecs_vpc_subnets_private_ids   = ["<ECS_VPC_SUBNET_PRIVATE_ID_1>","<ECS_VPC_SUBNET_PRIVATE_ID_2>"]

  existing_cloudtrail_config={
    cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs_arn = "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_ARN>"
    cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs_url = "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_URL>"

    #  optional, only if CLOUDTRAIL_S3 and SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID are in different accounts
    cloudtrail_s3_role_arn    = "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_ROLE_ARN>"
  }
}
```

- We'll use the **organizational** example
- **General** parameters
    - `AWS_REGION` Same region is to be used for both organizational managed account and Sysdig workload member account resources.<br/>
        - Region MUST be unique for all values, and match the location of S3 bucket, SNS and SQS
    - `SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID` where Sysdig Workload is to be deployed, optionally, under the pre-existing ECS<br/><br/>

- **Cloudtrail S3 SNS-SQS** Setup
  - `S3_BUCKET_ACCOUNT_ID` in order to authenticate aws provider on the member account
  - `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_NAME` name of the cloudtrail s3 bucket
  - `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_ARN` value gathered from 3.3 action point.
  - `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_URL` value gathered from 3.3 action point.
  - (Optional) `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_ROLE_ARN` ARN of the `SysdigSecureForCloud-S3AccessRole` created in step 3.2, for ECSTaskRole to assumeRole and access S3

- (Optional) Existing **ECS Cluster and networking** setup
    - `ECS_CLUSTER_NAME` ex.: "sfc"
    - `ECS_VPC_ID` ex.: "vpc-0e91bfef6693f296b"
    - `ECS_VPC_SUBNET_PRIVATE_ID_X` Two subnets for the VPC. ex.: "subnet-0c7d803ecdc88437b"<br/><br/>


#### 5.Optional. Permission setup when S3_BUCKET_ACCOUNT_ID != SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID

When applying Terraform manifest it will create resources, and we should have no errors there.
However, deployed compute will fail (can check the logs in the ECS Task) due to permissions.

Let's fix that; we need to allow S3 and SQS resources to be accessed by the compute role, `sfc-organizational-ECSTaskRole"` (default name value).

![organizational three-way-account permission setup](resources/org-three-with-s3-forward.png)

##### 5.1 Fetch `SYSDIG_ECS_TASK_ROLE_ARN` ARN

Get this ARN at hand, because it's what you'll use to configure your pre-existing CLOUDTRAIL_S3 and CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS permissions to allow SysdigWorkload to operate with it.

Default `SYSDIG_ECS_TASK_ROLE_ARN` should be `arn:aws:iam::<SYSDIG_SECURE_FOR_CLOUD_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/sfc-organizational-ECSTaskRole`
but you can check its value accessing the ECS Cluster and checking deployed Task definition, or launching following CLI

```bash
$ terraform state list | grep aws_iam_role.connector_ecs_task
<RESULTING_RESOURCE>

$ terraform state show <RESULTING_RESOURCE> | grep "arn"
arn = "arn:aws:iam::****:role/sfc-organizational-ECSTaskRole"
```

##### 5.2 Cloudtrail-S3-SNS-SQS

We'll need to add following permissions to the `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS`
```text
    {
      "Sid": "AllowSQSSubscribe",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "<SYSDIG_ECS_TASK_ROLE_ARN>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage"
      ],
      "Resource": "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_ARN>"
   }
```

##### 5.3 Cloudtrail-S3

We'll need to add following trust policy to the `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_ROLE`
```text
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "<SYSDIG_ECS_TASK_ROLE_ARN>"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
]
}
```

We should not need to restart ECSTask as this changes will be applied on runtime.

### 6. Check-up

- Access ECS logs for the SecureForCloud task and check that there are no errors and events are being ingested
- If logs are ok, [Sysdig Secure Docs - Secure for cloud - AWS - Confirm services are working](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-secure-for-cloud/deploy-sysdig-secure-for-cloud-on-aws/#confirm-the-services-are-working)
