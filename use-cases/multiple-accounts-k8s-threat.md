# Organizational Setup with Multiple Cloudtrail Connected to Single S3

## Overview

### User Setup

- [X] Multi-account setup
  - [X] Per-account cloudtrail, each reporting to their own S3 bucket
- [X] Pre-existing resources
  - [?] Multiple Cloudtrail-S3 buckets synced to a single S3 bucket to which an SQS is attached
  - [?] Multiple Cloudtrail-S3 buckets reporting to same SQS
  - [X] Kubernetes cluster you want to use to deploy Sysdig for Cloud workload
- [X] Permission setup
  - [?] Sysdig workload account usage: all the required and pre-existing resources exist in the same account
  - [?] Sysdig workload account usage: all the required resources are in scattered accounts

### Sysdig Secure For Cloud Features

From the [available features for Secure for cloud AWS](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/sysdig-secure-for-cloud/aws/#available-features)

- [X] Threat detection
  - [X] Account-specific
  - [?] All individual Cloudtrail accounts need to be analysed
- [ ] Image Scanning (ECR and ECS)
- [ ] Compliance / Benchmark
- [ ] CIEM

### Other Requirements

- [?] pre-existing kubernetes management v√≠a service account (WIP)

  This has not been tested yet; Sysdig rely on an `accessKeyId/secretAccessKey`
  <!--
  Skip step 4 and remove `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` parameters from `org_k8s_threat_reuse_cloudtrail` module
  -->

- [X] Ability to parametrize `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` on the [Kubernetes deployment configuration](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/cloud-connector/#configuration)

## Solution

If you require only threat detection feature for your multiple AWS accounts, and if you do not have an organizational Cloudtrail setup, use the instructions given in [cloud-connector `aws-cloudtrail-s3-sns-sqs` ingestor](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/cloud-connector/#ingestors).

The ingestor processes a single SQS AWS queue with the events reported from:

- a single S3 bucket through an SNS topic

- multiple S3 buckets with several SNS topics

## Preparation

1. Define different **AWS providers**:

    WIP.

    - We need to know the account where Sysdig Secure for cloud workload will be deployed
    - And the accounts where the cloudtrail-S3 bucket(s) will be
    <!--
       - Populate  `REGION`. Currently, same region is to be used
       - Because we are going to provision resources on multiple accounts, we're gonna use **two AWS providers**
           - `aws.s3` for s3-sns-sqs resources to be deployed. IAM user-credentials, to be used for k8s must also be in S3 account
           - `aws.sfc` for secure-for-cloud utility resources to be deployed

      ```terraform
      provider "aws" {
      alias = "s3"
      region = "<REGION>"
      ...
      }

      provider "aws" {
      alias = "sfc"
      region = "<REGION>"
      ...
      }
      ```
  -->

2. Prepare the **Helm provider** definition.

   1. Use the [cloud-connector chart](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/cloud-connector/) to deploy the Sysdig workload.

   2. Configure [**Helm** Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs) for **Kubernetes** cluster:

      For example:

      ```
      provider "helm" {
        kubernetes {
          config_path = "~/.kube/config"
        }
      }
      ```

3. Configure the Cloudtrail-S3-SNS-SQS setup

      WIP.

      Create an SQS queue that will subscribe to:

      - Single S3-SNS setup

        For more information, see the [one S3-SNS-SQS](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/infrastructure/cloudtrail_s3-sns-sqs) module.

      - Multiple S3 buckets with SNS topics

        We are working to provide a method to automatize this scenario.

    <!--
            1. Populate  `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_NAME`
               <br/>ex.:
                ```text
                cloudtrail_s3_name=cloudtrail-logging-237944556329
                ```
            2. Populate `CLOUDTRAIL_S3_FILTER_PREFIX` in order to ingest a specific-account. Otherwise, just remove its assignation
               <br/>ex.:
                ```text
                s3_event_notification_filter_prefix=cloudtrail/AWSLogs/237944556329
                ```

        ```terraform
        module "cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs" {
          providers = {
            aws = aws.s3
          }
          source  = "sysdiglabs/secure-for-cloud/aws//modules/infrastructure/cloudtrail_s3-sns-sqs"
          cloudtrail_s3_name = "<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_NAME>"
          s3_event_notification_filter_prefix="<CLOUDTRAIL_S3_FILTER_PREFIX>"
        }
        ```
    -->

4. Configure the Kubernetes multi-Account **AWS Permissions** to be able to handle S3/SQS operations:

      The  [cloud-connector chart](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/cloud-connector/)  requires specific AWS credentials to be passed by parameter, for which a new user and an access key will be created within the account. This credential will be used to fetch the events from a single or multiple e S3 buckets. Sysdig currently provide  [`modules/infrastructure/permissions/iam-user`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/blob/master/modules/infrastructure/permissions/iam-user) to retrieve events from a single S3 bucket.

      WIP.

      <!--

        ```terraform
        module "multi-account" {
           providers = {
              aws = aws.s3
           }
           source  = "sysdiglabs/secure-for-cloud/aws//modules/infrastructure/permissions/iam-user"
           deploy_image_scanning         = false
           cloudtrail_s3_bucket_arn      = module.cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs.cloudtrail_s3_arn
           cloudtrail_subscribed_sqs_arn = module.cloudtrail_s3_sns_sqs.cloudtrail_subscribed_sqs_arn
        }
        ```
        -->

5. Deploy the Sysdig workload on Kubernetes:

   - Populate  `sysdig_secure_url`, `SYSDID_SECURE_API_TOKEN` and `REGION`

   - WIP. Enable terraform module to be able to define [`nodeSelector` and `tolerations` parameters of the cloud-connector helm chart](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/cloud-connector/#configuration)

     ```yaml
     resource "helm_release" "cloud_connector" {

       provider = helm

       name = "cloud-connector"

       repository = "https://charts.sysdig.com"
       chart      = "cloud-connector"

       create_namespace = true
       namespace        = "sysdig"

       set {
         name  = "image.pullPolicy"
         value = "Always"
       }

       set {
         name  = "sysdig.url"
         value =  "<sysdig_secure_url>"
       }

       set_sensitive {
         name  = "sysdig.secureAPIToken"
         value = "<SYSDIG_SECURE_API_TOKEN>"
       }

       set_sensitive {
         name  = "aws.accessKeyId"
         value = "<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>"
       }

       set_sensitive {
         name  = "aws.secretAccessKey"
         value = "<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "aws.region"
         value = "<REGION>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "nodeSelector.<NODE_SELECTOR_LABEL>"
         value = "<NODE_SELECTOR_LABEL_VALUE>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "tolerations[0].key"
         value = "<TOLERATION_KEY>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "tolerations[0].operator"
         value = "<TOLERATION_OPERATOR>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "tolerations[0].value"
         value = "<TOLERATION_VALUE>"
       }

       set {
         name  = "tolerations[0].effect"
         value = "<TOLERATION_EFFECT>"
       }

       values = [
         <<CONFIG
     logging: info
     ingestors:
       - aws-cloudtrail-s3-sns-sqs:
           queueURL: CLOUDTRAIL_S3_SNS_SQS_URL
     CONFIG
       ]
     }
     ```
