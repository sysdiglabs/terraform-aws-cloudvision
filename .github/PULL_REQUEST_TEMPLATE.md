<!--
Thank you for your contribution!

## General recommendations
Check contribution guidelines at https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md#contribution-checklist

For a cleaner PR make sure you follow these recommendations:
- Review modified files and delete small changes that were not intended and maybe slip the commit.
- Use Pull Request Drafts for visibility on Work-In-Progress branches and use them on daily mob/pairing for team review
- Unless an external revision is desired, in order to validate or gather some feedback, you are free to merge as long as **validation checks are green-lighted**
