# Sysdig Secure for Cloud in AWS

Terraform module that deploys the **Sysdig Secure for Cloud** stack in **AWS**.
<br/>It provides unified threat detection, compliance, forensics and analysis.

There are three major components:

* **Cloud Threat Detection**: Tracks abnormal and suspicious activities in your cloud environment based on Falco language. Managed through [cloud-connector module](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/services/cloud-connector).<br/>

* **CSPM/Compliance**: It evaluates periodically your cloud configuration, using Cloud Custodian, against some benchmarks and returns the results and remediation you need to fix. Managed through [cloud-bench module](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/services/cloud-bench).<br/>

* **Cloud Scanning**: Automatically scans all container images pushed to the registry or as soon a new task which involves a container is spawned in your account.Managed through [cloud-scanning module](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/services/cloud-scanning).<br/>

For other Cloud providers check: [GCP](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-google-secure-for-cloud), [Azure](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-azurerm-secure-for-cloud)

<br/>

## Usage

There are several ways to deploy this in you AWS infrastructure:

### Single-Account
Sysdig workload will be deployed in the same account where user's resources will be watched.<br/>
More info in [`./examples/single-account`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/single-account)

![single-account diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/7d142829a701ce78f13691a4af4be373625e7ee2/examples/single-account/diagram-single.png)

### Organizational

Using an organizational configuration Cloudtrail.
More info in [`./examples/organizational`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples/organizational)

![organizational diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/7d142829a701ce78f13691a4af4be373625e7ee2/examples/organizational/diagram-org.png)

### Self-Baked

If no [examples](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/examples) fit your use-case, be free to call desired modules directly.

In this use-case we will ONLY deploy cloud-bench, into the target account, calling modules directly

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "AWS-REGION"
}

provider "sysdig" {
  sysdig_secure_api_token  = "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
}

module "cloud_bench" {
  source      = "sysdiglabs/secure-for-cloud/aws//modules/cloud-bench"
  account_id  = "AWS-ACCOUNT-ID" # can also be fetched from `aws_caller_identity.me`
}

```
See [inputs summary](#inputs) or main [module `variables.tf`](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/variables.tf) file for more optional configuration.

To run this example you need have your [aws master-account profile configured in CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) and to execute:
```terraform
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Notice that:
* This example will create resources that cost money.<br/>Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need them anymore
* All created resources will be created within the tags `product:sysdig-secure-for-cloud`, within the resource-group `sysdig-secure-for-cloud`

## Troubleshooting

- Q: How to **validate secure-for-cloud cloud-connector (thread-detection) provisioning** is working as expected?<br/>
  A: Check each pipeline resource is working as expected (from high to low lvl)
    - select a rule to break manually, from the 'Sysdig AWS Best Practices' policies. for example, 'Delete Bucket Public Access Block'. can you see the event?
    - are there any errors in the ECS task logs? can also check cloudwatch logs
      for previous example we should see the event
      ```
      {"level":"info","component":"console-notifier","time":"2021-07-26T12:45:25Z","message":"A pulic access block for a bucket has been deleted (requesting  user=OrganizationAccountAccessRole, requesting IP=x.x.x.x, AWS  region=eu-central-1, bucket=sysdig-secure-for-cloud-nnnnnn-config)"}
      ```
    - are events consumed in the sqs queue, or are they pending?
    - are events being sent to sns topic?


- Q: How to iterate **cloud-connector modification testing**
  <br/>A: Build a custom docker image of cloud-connector `docker build . -t <DOCKER_IMAGE> -f ./build/cloud-connector/Dockerfile` and upload it to any registry (like dockerhub).
  Modify the [var.image](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-aws-secure-for-cloud/tree/master/modules/services/cloud-connector/variables.tf) variable to point to your image and deploy


- Q: How can I iterate **ECS testing**
  <br/>A: After applying your modifications (v√≠a terraform for example) restart the service
    ```
    $ aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment --cluster sysdig-secure-for-cloud-ecscluster --service sysdig-secure-for-cloud-cloudconnector --profile <AWS_PROFILE>
    ```
  For the AWS_PROFILE, set your `~/.aws/config` to impersonate
    ```
    [profile secure-for-cloud]
    region=eu-central-1
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<AWS_MANAGEMENT_ORGANIZATION_ACCOUNT>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=<AWS_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_PROFILE>
    ```

 - Q: How to test **cloud-scanner** image-scanning?<br/>
   A: Upload any image to the ECR repository of AWS. You should see a log in the ECS-cloud-scanner task + CodeBuild project being launched successfully
